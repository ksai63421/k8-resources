requests: # soft-limit
          memoery: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
  limits: # hard-limit
  memeory: "128Mi"
  cpui: "500m"

  1 cpu == 1000m
  250m = 0.25 cpu

  soft limit is okay it can go upto 100mi
  hard limit it cannot go upto 128mi 

  by mistake it a defects in app ,it may get into the locks,it consume more memory, it can only block one container and not exceed above limit values, other cannot be affcted
  if you dont mention about limits it can block entire server resources so that other pods and conatiners are affcetd
